Data Visualization API -- Node.js, Graphql, PostgreSQL Backend

Node.js + GraphQL + PostgreSQL backend for NFL data visualization.

This uses prisma ORM between the Node.js and PostgreSQL :https://www.prisma.io/  https://www.prisma.io/docs/

Not sure how much I love prisma here. Going to stick with it for now but may ditch ORM entirely.
